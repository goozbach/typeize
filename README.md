# typeize 

I'm creating a system which will auto-record screencasts. This is a small part.

The human-like typing of a given string.  This is nothing but a proof of concept to go into my further work.

# usage
For best results, put the string to be typeized in quotes. This preserves multiple spaces for example

     ./typeize.sh "dood  this is two  spaces neato"
